Once upon a time there was a little girl who wore a red hood. 
She had a sick old grandma but she lived very far away.
Her mom asked her to send her grandma some sweets to help her get better.
She went on her way to her grandma's house which was across the dark forest.
She was biking through the woods when she heard a crack.
She just thought it was nothing but little did she know it was the big bad wolf.
